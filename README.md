# Push Notifications for phpBB

This extension adds Deskotp and Push notifications for supported devices and browsers to phpBB 3.2.

**Requirements**

 * \>= PHP 5.4
 * \>= phpBB 3.2

Using Google's FCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging) service, your phpBB 3.2 forum is able to send notifications to your user's browser and phone. This feature seamlessly integrates with the powerful notifications system built into phpBB.

You must sign up with FCM and create a project there in order to use this extension. There are credentials provided by that service that must be entered into the extension's configuration.
